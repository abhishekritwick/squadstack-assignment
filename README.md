Working Code for the functioning of a parking lot 


Steps to run the code : 

The code is written in Python 3.8
If not readily available, please use the virtual env attached in the repo. You can activate the virtualenv using the command as follows:
    -   source venv/bin/activate (for macintosh)
    
After the venv is up and running, you just need to run the parking_lot.py file using the following command:
    -   python parking_lot.py
    
The code asks for a filename that you need to provide, if a filename is not provided, it will read any fle with the name "input.txt" which is to be present in the same directory where the code exists (1 sample file is present in the repo as well)

After the filename is provided, the code should run and give the desired outputs. 

Please let me know if you face any issues.
